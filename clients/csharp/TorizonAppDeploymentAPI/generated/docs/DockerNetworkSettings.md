Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Bridge** | **string** | Name of the network&#39;a bridge (for example, &#x60;docker0&#x60;). | [optional] 
**SandboxID** | **string** | SandboxID uniquely represents a container&#39;s network stack. | [optional] 
**HairpinMode** | **bool** | Indicates if hairpin NAT should be enabled on the virtual interface.  | [optional]

**LinkLocalIPv6PrefixLen** | **int** | Prefix length of the IPv6 unicast address. | [optional] 
**Ports** | **Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;DockerPortBinding&gt;&gt;** | PortMap describes the mapping of container ports to host ports, using the container&#39;s port-number and protocol as key in the format &#x60;&lt;port&gt;/&lt;protocol&gt;&#x60;, for example, &#x60;80/udp&#x60;.  If a container&#39;s port is mapped for multiple protocols, separate entries are added to the mapping table.  | [optional] 
**SandboxKey** | **string** | SandboxKey identifies the sandbox | [optional]

This field was deprecated in Docker 1.9 and is scheduled &gt; to be removed in Docker 17.12.0  | [optional] 
**IPAddress** | **string** | IPv4 address for the default \&quot;bridge\&quot; network.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &gt; **Deprecated**: This field is only propagated when attached to the &gt; default \&quot;bridge\&quot; network.
