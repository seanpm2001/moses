              Whether this container is running.

              Note that a running container can be _paused_. The `Running` and `Paused`
              booleans are not mutually exclusive:

              When pausing a container (on Linux), the cgroups freezer is used to suspend
              all processes in the container. Freezing the process requires the process to
              be running. As a result, paused containers are both `Running` _and_ `Paused`.

              Use the `Status` field instead to determine if a container's state is "running".
